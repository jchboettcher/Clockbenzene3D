# Clockbenzene3D

### ABOUT
This program is an extension of a previous program, Clockbenzene2D (https://github.com/jchboettcher/Clockbenzene2D), except this one is in 3D. However, I have not yet added compatibility for when the clock hands overlap, so this project is incomplete as of now. However, all 3 hands exist, you can move around in 3D space, viewing the clock from any angle. I'll add more on how to use the widget once it is finished.

### NOTES
* See the 2D version at https://github.com/jchboettcher/Clockbenzene2D.
